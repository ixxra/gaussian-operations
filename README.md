#Gaussian elimination for (your) students

- Are you a teacher on linear algebra?
- Are you a student?
- Wouldn't be nice that, given a matrix, you could write something like this:


```
R2 -> R2 + 3 * R1
```

which is standard notation for *matrix operations* in linear algebra, and see what happens with the matrix?

This library pretend just to do so. 

Certainly, out there in the wild, there should be very good software to accomplish this task. But this project is twofold:

1. It aims to ease my linear algebra students life.
2. It aims to help my computer science students to learn python.

Your are more than welcome to participate.
